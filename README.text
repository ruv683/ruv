Comprehensive Analysis of Car Accidents 
By Ruvik Ramon

This project analyzes traffic accident data to identify key factors influencing accident severity. 
The dataset includes variables related to weather conditions, lighting, road defects, and accident severity levels.
Key findings show that nighttime and poorly light roads significantly increase fatality rates, while road defects contribute to higher accident severity. Weather conditions like rain and overcast skies have a notable impact, whereas snow conditions show lower fatality rates, possibly due to cautious driving. The predictive model captures general trends but struggles with extreme values, making it more suitable for trend analysis than precise forecasting. Recommendations include enhancing road lighting, improving maintenance, and increasing driver awareness in hazardous conditions to reduce accident fatalities.
